/**
 * The package org.opentosca.toscaengine.service.impl.toscareferencemapping
 * provides the functionality of a library for DOM Nodes. These Nodes are
 * referenced informations of TOSCA files. They are parsed out of TOSCA, XML
 * Schema and WSDL files. Nodes of TOSCA can be retrieved as JAXB objects
 * aswell.
 * 
 * This functionality is used by several components of the OpenTosca Container
 * to retrieve the required informations for further processing.
