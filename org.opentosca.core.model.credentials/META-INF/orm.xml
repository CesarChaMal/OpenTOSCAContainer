			<!-- 
			
			Some column names defined in Credentials persistence unit are reserved 
			names (e.g. "identity"). This JPA 2 setting put column names in quotes in 
			the created SQL statements, so reserved names as column names will be interpreted 
			correctly. 
				
			Note if this property is set and you want to define a unique constraint: 
			Due to a Eclipse Bug you must define a name for a unique constraint and 
			each column name in the constraint must be put in additional quotes 
			in the appropriate annotation. Otherwise the generated SQL statement 
			is not correct.
