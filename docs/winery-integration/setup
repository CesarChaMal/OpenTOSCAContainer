## Setup of the development env ##

1. Clone container, opentosca-docker and tosca-definitions-internal
2. adjust opentosca-docker's docker-compose to mount tosca-definitions-internal into the winery container
3. Follow the setup instructions in container's readme
    - Additionally adjust the run configuration generated by the product to include guava 15 instead of 21
    - Also make sure that ch.qos.logback dependencies point to 1.1.2 and **not** 1.2.3
4. Start the docker containers winery and ui with `docker-compose up -d winery ui` in opentosca-docker
5. Start the eclipse run-configuration and pray for the best
